# MyATM Project

## Installation Requirements

1. Node JS.
2. then run `npx live-server` and follow the prompts for a first time install.

## Description

MyATM is a simple yet efficient React-based web application that allows users to manage their account balance by performing deposit and cash back operations. The application showcases a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and input validation.

### Improvements

The following improvements have been made to the existing code:

1. A UI update to make the small app more usable.
2. Added input validation to prevent invalid transactions, such as negative amounts or cash back amounts greater than the current account balance.
3. Enhanced user experience by conditionally rendering the `ATMDeposit` component based on the user's selected action.
